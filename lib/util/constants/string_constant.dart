Selling shares to QIIs helps underwriters meet the targeted capital, thus, they try to sell them a large chunk of IPO shares at lucrative prices. If more shares are sold to QIIs, there will be less number of shares available for the public. This leads to an increase in the stock price, enabling the company to raise more capital. Thatâ€™s why SEBI has mandated that QIIs cannot be allocated more than 50% of shares.';

      "Individual investors or institutions (large trusts, big companies, and similar institutions) who are willing to invest more than â‚¹2 lakh are categorized as High Net Worth Individuals or Non-institutional Investors respectively. \N The major point of difference between QIIs and NIIs is that NIIs do not have to register themselves with SEBI. Generally, companies reserve 15% of the offer for NIIs/HNIs in an IPO.";

      "A dividend is a portion of a company's profits that it pays out to its shareholders, typically as a reward for investing in the company. Think of it as a bonus or extra money given to you if you own a part of the company (shares). \n\nSimple Example: \nImagine you own shares in a company. The company does well and makes a profit. The company then decides to share some of that profit with its shareholders. If you own 10 shares of the company, and the company pays a dividend of Rs. 1 per share, you'll receive Rs. 10 in dividends.Dividends can be paid in cash (like the example) or sometimes in additional shares of the company. Not all companies pay dividendsâ€”some prefer to reinvest the profits back into the business for growth.";


  static String bonusInfo= 'What Is Bonus Shares?';

"Bonus shares are extra shares given to existing shareholders for free, based on how many shares they already own. Companies do this to reward shareholders without paying cash.\n\nSimple Example:\nLetâ€™s say you own 10 shares of a company, and the company announces a 1:1 bonus share. This means youâ€™ll get 1 bonus share for every 1 share you own. So, youâ€™ll receive 10 extra shares for free, making your total shares 20. The price per share may reduce, but your total investment remains the same.";

  static String splitInfo= 'What Is Splits?';

"A stock split is when a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to make each share more affordable, without changing the total value of your investment.\n\nSimple Example:\nImagine you own 1 share of a company worth Rs. 100. The company announces a 2-for-1 stock split. This means for every 1 share you own, you'll now have 2 shares, but each will be worth Rs. 50 instead of Rs. 100. So, your total investment is still Rs.100, but you now own 2 shares instead of 1.";

  static String rightsInfo= 'What Is Rights?';
  static String rightsDesc=
"A rights issue is when a company gives its existing shareholders the option to buy additional shares at a discounted price before offering them to the public. It's a way for the company to raise more money.\n\nSimple Example:\nImagine you own 5 shares of a company, and it announces a rights issue offering 1 new share for every 5 shares you own at a discounted price of Rs.20 (when the current market price is Rs.30). You can choose to buy that 1 additional share at the lower price, helping the company raise funds and increasing your ownership.";
